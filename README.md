# Sora Henkan (空変換)

Sora Henkan is a powerful and scalable image processing service designed to handle on-the-fly image transformations. It provides a simple API to submit image URLs, apply transformations like scaling, and retrieve the processed images. The system is built with a decoupled architecture using a message queue, ensuring high throughput and resilience.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Image Processing:** Jobs are queued and processed in the background by workers, preventing API blocking.
- **Image Scaling:** Resize images by specifying target width and height.
- **Real-time Updates:** Subscribe to real-time progress updates for image processing jobs via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Cloud-Native:** Designed to run on the cloud with infrastructure-as-code for AWS.
- **Local Development:** A complete Docker Compose setup for easy local development and testing.
- **Observability:** Integrated OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics with Jaeger for distributed tracing visualization.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for easy API exploration and testing.
- **Health Monitoring:** Comprehensive health check endpoints for both API and worker services.
- **AMI-Based Deployment:** Fast instance launches using pre-built Amazon Machine Images.
- **Load Testing:** Built-in load testing capabilities for performance validation.
- **CloudWatch Integration:** AWS CloudWatch agent integration for detailed monitoring and logging.
- **CDN Support:** Cloudflare client IP extraction for accurate request tracking behind CDN.

## Architecture

Sora Henkan follows a distributed and decoupled architecture:

1.  **API Server (`api`):** A Go server built with the Echo framework. It exposes a RESTful API to accept image processing requests. When a new request is received, it saves the job details to the PostgreSQL database and publishes a message to an SQS queue.
2.  **Worker (`worker`):** A Go application that listens for messages on the SQS queue. When a message is received, it fetches the image from the source URL, performs the required transformations (e.g., scaling) using `libvips`, and uploads the original and transformed images to an S3-compatible object storage.
3.  **Frontend:** A React application (built with Vite) that provides a user interface to interact with the API.
4.  **PostgreSQL:** The primary database for storing information about image processing jobs.
5.  **MinIO/S3:** An object storage service used to store the original and processed images.
6.  **LocalStack/AWS SQS:** A message queue used to decouple the API server from the worker, enabling asynchronous processing.
7.  **Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision the necessary AWS resources, including VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, and SQS.
8.  **Jaeger:** Distributed tracing system for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based architectures.
9.  **CloudWatch Agent:** AWS monitoring and observability service for collecting metrics and logs from EC2 instances.

## API Endpoints

-   `POST /v1/images`: Create a new image processing request.
-   `GET /v1/images`: List all image processing jobs.
-   `GET /v1/images/:id`: Get details for a specific image processing job.
-   `GET /v1/images/sse`: Get real-time updates for all jobs.
-   `GET /v1/images/:id/sse`: Get real-time updates for a specific job.
-   `GET /health`: API server health check endpoint.
-   `GET /swagger/*`: Swagger UI for interactive API documentation (OpenAPI 3.0).

### API Documentation

The API is fully documented using OpenAPI 3.0 specification. You can explore and test the API interactively using Swagger UI:

- **Local development:** `http://localhost:42069/swagger/index.html`
- **Regenerate API documentation:** `task swagger:generate`

The OpenAPI specification file is located at `docs/openapi.yaml`.

### Example Request

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:42069/v1/images -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "image_url": "https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/thumbnails/image/j2m-shareable.jpg",
  "scale_transformation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "width": 200,
    "height": 200
  }
}'
```

## Configuration

The application is configured using YAML files located in the `settings/` directory. The `base.yaml` file contains default settings, which can be overridden by environment-specific files or environment variables.

For example, to change the database host for the API, you can set the `API_DATABASE_HOST` environment variable.

## Load Testing

The project includes a load testing script using k6 located in the `loadgenerator/` directory. This allows you to test the performance and scalability of the image processing service.

To run load tests:

```sh
cd loadgenerator
docker build -t sora-henkan-loadgen .
docker run --rm sora-henkan-loadgen
```

The load test script (`script.js`) includes a set of anime image URLs and simulates realistic user traffic patterns.

## Observability

### Distributed Tracing with Jaeger

The application integrates Jaeger for distributed tracing, allowing you to visualize request flows across the API and worker services. In AWS deployments, Jaeger UI is exposed through the Application Load Balancer.

### CloudWatch Integration

For AWS deployments, the CloudWatch agent collects metrics and logs from EC2 instances, providing comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.

### OpenTelemetry

All services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry for standardized observability, including:
- Request tracing
- Performance metrics
- Custom application metrics

## Deployment

The infrastructure for this project is defined using Terraform in the `terraform/shitty-aws-architecture/` directory. The Terraform code provisions all the necessary resources on AWS to run the application in a scalable and resilient manner.
